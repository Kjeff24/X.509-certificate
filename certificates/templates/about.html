      <h2>About the X.509 Certificate Generator</h2>
      <p>
        The X.509 Certificate Generator is a web-based tool that allows users to
        generate X.509 certificates quickly and easily. X.509 certificates are a
        standard format for digital certificates used in public key
        infrastructure (PKI). These certificates are commonly used for securing
        communication channels, establishing trust, and verifying the
        authenticity of digital entities.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Easy Certificate Generation: The X.509 Certificate Generator
          simplifies the process of creating X.509 certificates. Users can
          provide the necessary information and generate certificates with just
          a few clicks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Customizable Certificate Attributes: The generator allows users to
          specify various attributes for the certificates, including the subject
          name, issuer name, validity period, and other relevant details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secure and Reliable: The generated X.509 certificates adhere to
          industry standards and best practices, ensuring their security and
          reliability. They are created using robust cryptographic algorithms
          and signing mechanisms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Use</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Access the X.509 Certificate Generator website.</li>
        <li>

        <li>
          Prototyping and Proof of Concept: For individuals and teams working on
          projects that require certificate-based authentication or encryption,
          the X.509 Certificate Generator enables the rapid creation of
          prototype certificates for initial testing and proof of concept
          purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The X.509 Certificate Generator should be used responsibly and solely
          for legitimate purposes. Generating certificates for unauthorized
          activities or without proper authorization is strictly prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is essential to protect the private key associated with the
          generated certificate. Ensure that it is stored securely and not
          shared or exposed to unauthorized individuals.
        </li>
