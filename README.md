# X.509 Certificate Generator

The X.509 Certificate Generator is a web-based tool that allows users to generate X.509 certificates quickly and easily. X.509 certificates are a standard format for digital certificates used in public key infrastructure (PKI). These certificates are commonly used for securing communication channels, establishing trust, and verifying the authenticity of digital entities.

## Key Features

- Easy Certificate Generation: The X.509 Certificate Generator simplifies the process of creating X.509 certificates. Users can provide the necessary information and generate certificates with just a few clicks
- Customizable Certificate Attributes: The generator allows users to specify various attributes for the certificates, including the subject name, issuer name, validity period, and other relevant details.

- Secure and Reliable: The generated X.509 certificates adhere to industry standards and best practices, ensuring their security and reliability. They are created using robust cryptographic algorithms and signing mechanisms.

## Installation

To install the project, you need to have Python 3 and pip installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository: 
[X.509 CERTIFICATE](https://github.com/Kjeff24/X.509-certificate.git)
- Create a virtual environment: 
```
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment: 
```
`source venv/bin/activate` (on Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
```
- Install the required dependencies: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the development server, where certificate.pem and key.pem files are required in order to use X.509 CERTIFICATE for the localhost url
``` 
python manage.py runsslserver --cert certificate.pem --key key.pem
```
NB: Do not use <span style="color: red;"> python manage.py runserver</span>

- By default the development server will start at [https://127.0.0.1:8000/](https://127.0.0.1:8000/) 

- You can use [https://localhost.com:8000/](https://localhost.com:8000/) if and only your hosts file has the server localhost.com

## How to Use
1. Access the X.509 Certificate Generator website.

2. Fill in the required details for the certificate, such as the subject name, issuer name, and validity period.

3. Click the "Generate Certificate" button.

4. The X.509 Certificate Generator will generate the certificate based on the provided information and present it for download.

## Use Cases
- Development and Testing: The X.509 Certificate Generator is a valuable tool for developers and testers who need to create sample certificates for local development or testing environments.

- Education and Learning: The generator serves as an educational resource, allowing students and enthusiasts to explore the process of X.509 certificate generation and understand the underlying concepts.

- Prototyping and Proof of Concept: For individuals and teams working on projects that require certificate-based authentication or encryption, the X.509 Certificate Generator enables the rapid creation of prototype certificates for initial testing and proof of concept purposes.


## Security Considerations
- The X.509 Certificate Generator should be used responsibly and solely for legitimate purposes. Generating certificates for unauthorized activities or without proper authorization is strictly prohibited.
- It is essential to protect the private key associated with the generated certificate. Ensure that it is stored securely and not shared or exposed to unauthorized individuals.
